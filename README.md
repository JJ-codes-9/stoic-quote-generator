# Stoic Quote Generator for Absolutely No Reason

A gloriously unnecessary app that delivers random Stoic quotes with the click of a button — because sometimes you need Marcus Aurelius to tell you to calm down.

## Features

- Generates random Stoic quotes from an API
- Stylish, sarcastic interface
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Powered by a custom Express.js backend to avoid CORS issues

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Express.js (Node.js backend)
- Fetch API
- Media queries for responsive design

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jj-codes-9/stoic-quote-generator.git
cd stoic-quote-generator
npm install
node server.js
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Why?

Honestly, I don’t know either. But it works. And it’s Stoic.
